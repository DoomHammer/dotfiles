# Zsh always executes zshenv. Then, depending on the case:
# - run as a login shell, it executes zprofile;
# - run as an interactive, it executes zshrc;
# - run as a login shell, it executes zlogin.
#
# At the end of a login session, it executes zlogout, but in reverse order, the
# user-specific file first, then the system-wide one, constituting a chiasmus
# with the zlogin files.

test -r ~/.shell-logout && source ~/.shell-logout
